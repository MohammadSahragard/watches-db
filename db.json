This sophisticated update to our Standard 3-Hand brings together classic elements with modern materials that emphasize a military-inspired look—from the unique shape of the hands to a cream emboldened and embellished, partial Arabic dial—courtesy of our very own archives. The hour markers are carefully set against smaller minute markers on the outer ring, while an easily interchangeable brown leather and woven fabric strap complements the understated, ultra-slim case. The Standard 3-Hand hints at history once more with its traditional, oversized “onion” crown: a nod to our early 1900s pocket watch.",

Van Gogh's expressive likeness boasts bold brushstrokes, intoxicating movement, and vibrant colors, which continue down the leather strap, while a silver-tone case creates a subtle yet sophisticated frame around the dial. Equipped with a quartz movement for superior timekeeping and a scratch-resistant mineral glass for a crystal-clear view of Van Gogh's image, this watch transforms a Met collection masterpiece into a timeless work of wearable art.",

A fusion of technology and craftsmanship, every detail has been meticulously crafted to deliver a sophisticated timepiece. Completing the ensemble is a strap made from highly durable synthetic rubber, offering comfort and longevity, paired with a custom designed solid stainless-steel 316L deployant clasp.

This 1960s-inspired timepiece pairs the purity and pleasure of a hand-wound mechanical movement with the timeless sophistication of a sleek design. Wind the crown until you feel a slight resistance. This is best done at the same time each day to keep the watch continually running. For a new aesthetic update to the classically-proportioned dial, this version features an off-white California dial with both Arabic and Roman-numeral markings, plus a classic green croco-pattern leather strap for some extra retro appeal. In keeping with its 34mm case size, this version of our Marlin will fit wrists up to seven and one-half inches in size; if your own wrist size requires a longer strap, any 18mm strap of your choice will do.",

Featuring a case, bracelet, and dial crafted from upcycled, ocean-bound plastic, this remarkable wristwatch is the first Timex of its kind. Our partnership with #tide™ means its journey from waste to wrist begins with fishermen collecting plastic from the coastlines; the waste is washed and shredded before making its way to Switzerland via carbon-neutral transportation; and finally, it's repurposed on-site, resulting in a premium, sustainable material. Waterbury Ocean's pink, marine-inspired dial features unique flakes of shredded material, while the classic Waterbury construction itself honors our rich legacy in traditional watchmaking. Navigate uncharted waters ahead with all the trusted functionality you'd expect from a Timex—luminant hands and 30 meters of water resistance—and join us in working toward a cleaner tomorrow.",
