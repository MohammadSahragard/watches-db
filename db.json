All that functionality comes in a 38mm stainless-steel case and bracelet. For the mechanical movement, wind the crown until you feel a slight resistance. This is best done at the same time each day to keep the watch continually running.",

The dial is encased in a domed sapphire crystal with anti-glare coating and features stainless-steel hour markers that create a captivating visual aesthetic. Adding to its allure, a transparent case back offers a glimpse into the intricate automatic movement, revealed beneath a sapphire crystal. Powered by a high-quality Swiss Made automatic movement, the S2 watch ensures precision and reliability with 26 jewels and 41-hour power reserve. A fusion of technology and craftsmanship, every detail has been meticulously crafted to deliver a sophisticated timepiece. Completing the ensemble is a strap made from highly durable synthetic rubber, offering comfort and longevity, paired with a custom designed solid stainless-steel 316L deployant clasp. It's time to embark on a journey where elegance meets innovation, where the artistry of Swiss watchmaking seamlessly blends with Timex's iconic heritage.",

This 1960s-inspired timepiece pairs the purity and pleasure of a hand-wound mechanical movement with the timeless sophistication of a sleek design. Wind the crown until you feel a slight resistance. This is best done at the same time each day to keep the watch continually running. For a new aesthetic update to the classically-proportioned dial, this version features an off-white California dial with both Arabic and Roman-numeral markings, plus a classic green croco-pattern leather strap for some extra retro appeal. In keeping with its 34mm case size, this version of our Marlin will fit wrists up to seven and one-half inches in size; if your own wrist size requires a longer strap, any 18mm strap of your choice will do.",

To honor those early hits, we're proudly reintroducing the T80 for a whole new generation – a watch that's both a stylish accessory and a serious timekeeping device. The fun, retro design in all-purple — which now features our Perfect Fit stainless-steel expansion band technology — packs a date display, stopwatch, and alarm into something that looks great no matter where you're going from here. Note: The circumference on our T80 expansion band watch is 183mm. Additional links can be easily removed to make the watch smaller for a look and fit you'll love.",

Featuring a case, bracelet, and dial crafted from upcycled, ocean-bound plastic, this remarkable wristwatch is the first Timex of its kind. Our partnership with #tide™ means its journey from waste to wrist begins with fishermen collecting plastic from the coastlines; the waste is washed and shredded before making its way to Switzerland via carbon-neutral transportation; and finally, it's repurposed on-site, resulting in a premium, sustainable material. Waterbury Ocean's pink, marine-inspired dial features unique flakes of shredded material, while the classic Waterbury construction itself honors our rich legacy in traditional watchmaking. Navigate uncharted waters ahead with all the trusted functionality you'd expect from a Timex—luminant hands and 30 meters of water resistance—and join us in working toward a cleaner tomorrow.",

Each watch displays our attention to craftsmanship and detail, with finely-finished surfaces and careful applications of watchmaking ingenuity. Featuring a classic green dial and a rich caramel brown leather strap, our Waterbury Traditional Chronograph unites all of these elements into something that delivers function just as well as form. The watch's dial has three sub-dials — chronograph minutes and hours, as well as running seconds — laid out in a brushed inner circle to provide depth and detail, and it also features an ever-practical date display window situated at four o'clock.",
